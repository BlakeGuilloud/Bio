    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>Born and raised in Beaufort, SC, I grew up on the water, and typically in a boat, until I discovered computers. <br>
      <br>
      When I was 15, I began competing professionally in Real Time Strategy video games, specifically, "Warcraft 3", not to be confused with the much lamer, nerdier "World of Warcraft". I competed under the alias: Tantra, and made a decent amount of money doing so, until my parents told me it would get me no where. Unfortunately, they were right.

    <h1>Costa Rica</h1>
    <p>When I was 21, I moved and lived in Costa Rica for nearly 4 months, travelling between Guanacaste and the southern border of Nicaragua. I worked on a self-sustaining farm with no running water and no electricty, and learned more about myself than I ever knew. I discovered a love for sustainable agriculture, and have been an avid gardener since(I do not own a farm). </p>

    <h1>Charleston</h1>
    <p>I moved to Charleston in 2008, and immediately began working in this beautiful city. I washed dishes at a French restaurant for about 4 months, before becoming the salad chef(it's more impressive than it sounds). After a year or so, I quit La Fourchette, and helped a family open a restaurant on Cannon St called "Dellz Deli", where I happily worked on and off for the following three years. During my time with Dellz, I met the owner of a Rickshaw company in Charleston, and we became decent acquaintances over the years, until he offered me a job. I was obviously concerned about my ability to pedal a 300 LB tricycle around all day on top of the countless pounds of tourists that "felt so bad for me" while I pedalled their fat-asses around the city. I quickly discovered my passion for mechanic work, and became the mechanic/manager for the company until it drove me insane. <br><br>
    During my time with Charleston Rickshaw, I began working at Holy City Breweing 2-3 days a week, until finally going full-time in 2014. I love beer, and I mean that in every sense of the word; however, I would have died if I continued working there, thus bringing me to you lovely people. I heard about The Iron Yard through a friend, and he quickly convinced me that the effort you put forth in this program will carry on with you as a career skill. I am looking forward to everyday I get to spend listening to Calvin's resplendent voice, along with his cheesey jokes.
